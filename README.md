## Build instructions

I've only built on macOS 10.15 using Xcode 11.3. I installed third-party libs (like zlib and openssl) via brew.

1. Python 3.8 has to be installed into python3.8. I built it from source. On macOS 10.15, I had problems getting Python to find zlib and openssl. I had to do something like this:

        export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="$PKG_CONFIG_PATH:/usr/local/opt/zlib/lib/pkgconfig:/usr/local/opt/openssl@1.1/lib/pkgconfig"
        export LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/opt/zlib/lib -L/usr/local/opt/openssl@1.1/lib"
        export CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/opt/zlib/include -I/usr/local/opt/openssl@1.1/include"
        make clean ; ./configure --prefix=/path/to/VVVVVV/python3.8 && make

    At the end of `make`, you'll get a list of modules that aren't being built. If you see _ssl or zlib on that list, you'll run into problems during `make install` or `pip` network operations.

2. Create a virtualenv:

        ./python3.8/bin/python3 -mvenv python3.8-venv
        ./python3.8-venv/bin/pip install -r desktop_version/src/swnhook/requirements.txt

3. Follow build instructions as normal. Copy data.zip from the commercial game into flibitBuild in order to run, and run it with `flibitBuild` as your working directory.

## Invocation notes

    cd desktop_version/flibitBuild
    ./vvvvvv.osx

* SWNHook.cpp has a relative path reference to `../src`, where it expects to find the `swnhook` python module (ie. `desktop_version/src/swnhook`). Assumption is that you're running it from `desktop_version/flibitBuild`, a directory that's a sibling to `src/`.
* `desktop_version/src/swnhook/__init__.py` contains a reference to `../../python3.8-venv/bin/activate_this.py` which is checked in to the repo. Assumption is that you're running from `desktop_version/flibitBuild` and put your Python venv into `<git_root>/python3.8-venv`.
